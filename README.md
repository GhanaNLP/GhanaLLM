# GhanaLLM

A community-driven project for experimenting with large language models for indigenous Ghanaian languages.

## Overview

As research around large language models (LLMs) continues to evolve, new opportunities are emerging to address long-standing challenges faced by low-resource languages. The GhanaLLM Project aims to establish a common reference point and standardized training approach for developing LLMs capable of performing a wide range of tasks in Ghanaian languages â€” all built upon a shared base model and powered by community support and experience sharing. Our common base model is [Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) due to its broad multilingual training and resource efficient size.
